    <!--The JavaScript has an array and calls a function which I called myFunction
        from the forEach method of the array.
        forEach is an iteration method
        like a for(int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++) in C# - 
        in JavaScript the array length is array.length
        except this one will run for each of the array elements in turn
        what it is saying is for each element in the array called stringThings
        run the function myFunction and use the things about this array as the parameters
    -->

        const stringThings = ["Toyota", "bus", "tennis ball", "dustbin", "banana", "chicken liver", "chicken curry"

        /*The next line defines myFunction
         * value is the value of the array elemnt being passed
         * in this example the 0th one is "Toyota" and the last one is "barbq"
         * the index is the element number so 0 through 7 - for an 8 element array
         * array is the array
         * */
